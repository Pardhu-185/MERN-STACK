    <h1>Introduction to Mern Satck</h1>
    <p class="first">
        The MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, 
        is a popular web development framework that allows developers to build 
        full-stack web applications entirely in JavaScript. Each technology in 
        the stack plays a crucial role in enabling efficient development of both 
        the frontend and backend. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, stores application 
        data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Express is a lightweight framework 
        for building server-side applications on top of Node.js, which provides a 
        powerful runtime environment for JavaScript outside the browser. Together, 
        they form the backbone of the backend in the MERN stack.
    </p>
    <p class="last">
        React, the frontend component of the stack, is a JavaScript library that makes 
        it easy to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces. It allows developers 
        to create reusable components and manage application state efficiently, providing 
        a seamless user experience. When combined with Node.js, the MERN stack enables 
        developers to work with JavaScript on both the client and server sides, simplifying 
        the development process. The MERN stack is widely adopted by companies and startups 
        because it offers a unified development experience, strong performance, and flexibility 
        to build modern, scalable web applications. Its open-source nature and large community 
        make it an excellent choice for developers looking to build high-quality applications 
        quickly and efficiently.
